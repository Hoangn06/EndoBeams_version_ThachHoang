# EndoBeams

`EndoBeams.jl` is a Julia finite element package for beam-to-surface contact problems. The package is based on a 3D FE corotational formulation for frictional contact dynamics of beams where the target surface, supposed rigid, is described implicitly using a Signed Distance Field (SDF), predefined in a volumetric grid.

## 🚀 Features

- Corotational beam elements for modeling quasi-inextensible wire structures with large displacements
- Implicit surface description via signed distance fields (SDF) on a regular voxel grid
- Frictional contact handling with penalty and regularized friction models
- Highly optimized Julia implementation (faster than MATLAB, comparable or better than Abaqus for specific applications)
- Built-in examples for cantilever bending, impact, net drop, and braided stent deployment

## 📦 Installation

Install using Julia's package manager:

```
using Pkg
Pkg.add(url="https://github.com/bisighinibeatrice/EndoBeams.jl")
```

## ▶️ Examples
Example simulations are located in the `examples/` directory:

- `angle.jl` — Cantilever beam under vertical loading
- `ring.jl` — Ring dropping onto a rigid surface
- `net.jl` — Net dropped onto a rigid sphere
- `stent.jl` — Braided stent deployed into a rigid cylindrical vessel

Each script includes:

- Mesh reading or writing 
- Node and element construction
- Contact and solver setup
- Simulation loop
- Result export to `.vtk` files (for ParaView)
